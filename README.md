## Features

- Small memory footprint.
- Double and single-page mode.
- Comic and manga-mode (left-to-right and right-to-left page order).
- Smart scrolling.
- Basic scaling modes: original size, fit to height, fit to width, best fit.
- Image effects: horizontal flip, vertical flip.
- Bookmarks.
- Randomized page ordering.
- Can navigate between CG scenes (based on image similarity).

## Requirements

gtk3, gdk-pixbuf2, glib2. For compiling from source, go and go-bindata are also required.

## Installation
Run `./make.sh`. To run gomics, execute bin/gomics.

Prebuilt binaries are currently only provided for Linux. It's recommended that you use one of them if possible, because they are less likely to include breaking changed compared to a binary built from source. https://github.com/krischerven/gomics/releases
